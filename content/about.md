Hey there! I'm Misko Lee, and I'm not your typical programmer. I didn't come from a traditional computer science or engineering background. In fact, most of my early life was all about music and writing. When I was young, I spent a ton of time competing in literary contests. But my journey into programming was a bit unexpected and started with a unique opportunity.

Back in the day, I was all about music and writing, chasing my dreams. But things took a turn when I earned some cash from composing music. I used that money to buy my very first desktop computer, and that's when I first crossed paths with coding.

In the early years, I got obsessed with learning data structures and algorithms, purely out of interest. It was a time when I genuinely enjoyed the thrill of computer science. Then, as 3G mobile internet started gaining traction, my interests shifted towards the internet business, and I transitioned my tech stack from C/C++ to PHP and Java.

Starting in 2012, I dove headfirst into the internet world and began my career as an engineer. Over the past decade or so, I've gathered experience in various fields, including:

**Multimedia Development:** I've been part of projects involving multimedia applications, like music and video processing, to provide users with rich media experiences.

**Fintech:** I've worked in the fintech sector, developing financial applications and solutions, aiming to deliver secure and efficient financial services.

**Gaming:** Game development has always been a passion of mine, and I've had the chance to work on game projects, creating exciting gaming experiences for players.

**Social Media Marketing:** I've gained experience in the realm of social media, helping businesses and brands establish an online presence and engage with their audience on social platforms.

What's even more interesting is that in the last couple of years (starting around 2018), I've developed a strong interest in real-time audio applications & machine learning in audio, and I even started a Startup to specialize in these kinds of programming challenges.

My coding journey has been all about change and diversity, just like my interests have evolved over time. I believe that cross-disciplinary experiences and a diverse skill set help me broaden my horizons in the programming world and come up with unique solutions.

Looking ahead, I'll continue to innovate in the programming field, share my experiences and insights, and look forward to exploring this world full of opportunities and challenges with like-minded individuals.

Thanks for following my story, and if you have any questions about my journey or the programming world, feel free to reach out. Let's embark on new adventures together!
